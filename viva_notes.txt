NebulaSim - Viva Notes

Project: NebulaSim - Interactive space object simulation in C
Team: <Name1>, <Name2>, <Name3>

Short description:
NebulaSim models particles moving randomly on a 2D grid. Particles may collide and merge, their energy determines brightness, and frames can be saved and replayed.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Arrays and 2D grid representation
- Structures (Particle) to store object data
- Pointers (function parameter passing)
- Loops and decision-making for update rules
- File I/O for saving and replaying frames
- Modular programming: nebula.c/.h and main.c

Algorithm summary:
- initializeParticles: random positions and energies
- For each step:
  - moveParticles: random delta -1,0,+1 in x,y
  - handleCollisions: merge particles that share coordinates
  - updateBrightness: set brightness, remove dead particles
  - saveToFile: write ASCII snapshot to steps/stepXXXX.txt (if saving)
- replaySimulation reads step files sequentially and displays them.

Limitations & assumptions:
- Simplified physics (random drift rather than real gravity)
- Maximum number of particles capped (MAX_PARTICLES)
- Cross-platform differences: terminal clearing and mkdir commands are best-effort.

Possible extensions:
- Add real forces (attraction/repulsion)
- Implement a GUI (outside syllabus)
- Add energy transfer rules, spawn/despawn logic
- Visual color output using ANSI codes

Demo commands:
- make
- ./NebulaSim
